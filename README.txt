Here's how you use this.

When you bring up the web page, it asks you for the upper-left value in the (single) Jeopardy! board.  All the other values, including the "You can bet up to this for a Daily Double if you have less than the maximum amount for that round" are based off this starting value.  In the current versino of "Jeopardy!", that value is (the default) $200.  For "Celebrity Jeopardy!", it's $100.

You can enter some identifying information about the show at the top if you'd like.

Type in the category names for each round.

To play, use the left mouse button (or tap) to cycle a clue's value from unvisited (background color) to unanswered (gray) to correct (green) to incorrect (red).  One idea is that when a contestant selects a clue, change it to "unanswered" then.

To place a Daily Double or Final Jeopardy! bet, right click (or long-tap) the cell.  Enter your bet.  For a Daily Double, the lower limit is $5, and the upper limit is the larger of the bottom row values and your actual amount.  After you enter a valid bet, the dollar amount will be bolded.  If it's a true daily double (i.e., you bet all you've got), it'll be bold and italicized.  It's up to you whether you'd like to count a nonresponse of yours as incorrect or unanswered.

For Final Jeopardy!, the mechanics for placing your bet is the same as during the earlier rounds.  The difference here are 1) the minimum bet is $0, and 2) Once you place your final bet, you can't change any of the responses of the cells in the earlier rounds.

There are three boxes in the lower-right for recording the actual contestants' scores.

This can be printed or saved to PDF.  Instead of the cells being filled with color, the cells will have an outline of the appropriate color.
